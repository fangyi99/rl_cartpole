# Balancing a Pole on a Cart

The Cartpole problem is a classic problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to keep a pole balanced upright on a moving cart.

2 reinforcement learning techniques were applied:
- Q-Learning
- Monte Carlo REINFORCE

Both algorithms learn an optimal policy by interacting with the environment over time, improving their decisions based on the rewards received.
